Swimming at the mesoscale has been a topic of growing interest over the past two decades due to the unique dynamics that arise at low Reynolds numbers, a regime where viscous forces dominate over inertial ones. In this environment, motion becomes nonintuitive: as described by the scallop theorem, a swimmer with only one degree of freedom cannot achieve net displacement because its movement is time-reversible under the Navier–Stokes equations.
Despite these physical constraints, nature has evolved remarkable strategies to overcome them. Many microorganisms exhibit nonreciprocal motion, allowing them to propel themselves even in highly viscous media. For instance, \textit{Escherichia Coli} uses a rotating flagellum to push fluid backward, propelling the bacterium forward.
Inspired by such biological systems, researchers have sought to engineer artificial swimmers capable of movement under similar conditions. One notable example involves bacterial micromotors, where a ratchet-shaped structure is immersed in a bacterial bath. The bacteria, moving along ballistic trajectories, collide with the asymmetric surface of the ratchet, transferring momentum that induces rotation. Over time, however, this motion ceases as the bacteria exhaust the nutrients in their medium, requiring replenishment to sustain activity.
This form of active matter relies on energy extracted from its environment. Yet a natural question arises: can we achieve similar directed motion using anisotropically driven—but externally controlled—systems?

In this work, we analyze paramagnetic colloids manipulated by an external precessing magnetic field. The system is confined in the \textit{z} axis by two glass plates and presents periodic boundary conditions in \textit{x}, and \textit{y} axis. When multiple particles are present, dipole-dipole interactions arise, leading to either attraction or repulsion depending on their head-to-tail alignment. The particles' internal magnetic moment also rotate, dynamically altering their interactions over time. We observe that at low frequencies, the colloids form pairs and start rotating with a shared center of mass, whereas from 3.25 to 7Hz particles have a moment of repulsion, creating a neighbor exchange between different pairs, which produce a ballistic trajectory. To investigate wether this motion can perform work, we place a ratchet-like object with different parameters amidst the particles. At the pair rotation frequency regime it was observed how the angular frequency was almost negligible, while in the neighbor exchange regime it can't be described by the thermal noise.
