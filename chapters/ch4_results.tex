\chapter{Results}

To obtain some statistics from 230 simulations per ratchet, we decided to obtain the mean angular velocity over the different seeds of each frequency, and to validate the accuracy of each result, we used the error over the mean~\cite{altman2005standard}:

\begin{equation}
  \sigma_{\bar{x}} = \displaystyle\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}.
  \label{eq:errormean}
\end{equation}

Figure~\ref{fig:angularvsfrequency} summarizes the main result of this work, showing how the average angular velocity of the system changes with the frequency of the rotating magnetic field. At low frequencies (0â€“3 Hz), the internal dipoles of the paramagnetic colloids can align and rotate in phase with the external field, producing almost no net rotation of the ratchet. In this regime, the particles are merely diffusive, which aligns with theoretical expectations.

As the frequency increases, the dipoles begin to experience a delay relative to the field rotation. This phase lag reduces the alignment efficiency, and the system gradually loses synchronization, reaching a peak mean angular velocity at 5 Hz. Beyond this critical frequency, the particles no longer move by exchanging neighbors but instead begin to experience enhanced diffusion.

We also observe that the geometry of the ratchet does not play a significant role in the speed; however, it has a non-negligible impact for the spin down ratchets.

This behavior demonstrates how the balance between magnetic coupling and field rotation controls the system's dynamics. The critical frequency marks the transition out of the ratchet-like regime, beyond which the system becomes dominated by thermal fluctuations and phase delay.

Figure~\ref{fig:particletrj} shows the particle trajectories for two representative cases: 0 Hz and 5 Hz. When no field rotation is applied (0 Hz), the particles move randomly due to thermal noise, producing isotropic diffusion with no net direction, although it is evident that the particles that are closer to the ratchet feels an attraction towards, whereas the further ones reamin almost fixed in one place not experiencing the same displacement. This may be due to the repulsive forces they experience from the other colloids, and since in the middle there are any, they move freely towards the center. At 5 Hz, however, the trajectories reveal a rotational pattern, indicating that the dipoles are not synchronized with the external field and move collectively. This difference confirms that the rotation frequency of the magnetic field directly controls the transition from random to directed motion, as also reflected in the angular velocity results shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:angularvsfrequency}, it is highlighted the trajectory of one single particle to be able to see the difference in the behavior it has each driving frequency. For 0 Hz, the trajectory seems to be quasi-static, nevertheless for 5 Hz it is evident the chaotic movement the particles have.

Since the angular velocity has very strong fluctuations, a graph over the time will not give us important visual guides wether to determine the properties. Therefore we used a type of convolution known as moving average to obtain a smoother plot. This type of mean focus on a group of values to then forget them to focus on another new group. According to ~\cite{hyndman2025moving} a two and one sided averges are given respectively by:

\begin{align}
  z_t &= \frac{1}{2k+1} \sum^{k}_{j =-k} y_{t+j}, \quad t=k+1, k+2,\dots,n-k,\\
  z_t &= \frac{1}{k+1} \sum^{k}_{j =0} y_{t-j}, \quad t=k+1, k+2,\dots,n.
  \label{eq:movingaverage}
\end{align}

This, in fact, is a low-pass filter, perfect for the high peak fluctations.

Figure~\ref{fig:velocityvstime} presents the time evolution of the angular velocity. At 0 Hz, the system exhibits only random fluctuations caused by thermal noise, with an average angular velocity close to zero. In contrast, at 5 Hz, the angular velocity remains consistently positive over time, despite instantaneous fluctuations. The rolling mean highlights this difference, showing a neet rotational trend, in certain points, that reflects the impact the collective rotation of colloids have in the rotation of the ratchet.


This comparison illustrates how applying a conic rotating magnetic field transforms purely diffusive motion into coherent rotation, consistent with the averaged results in Fig.~\ref{fig:angularvsfrequency}.

Due to the inherent variability of stochastic processes, a large amount of data is required to obtain reliable statistics. Figure~\ref{fig:histogram} shows the angular velocity histograms for 0 Hz and 5 Hz. Interestingly enough, the data showed a gaussian distribtuion and just as we did with the moving average, we used a Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to smooth out the histogram ~\cite{chen2017tutorial}. 

\begin{equation}
  \hat{p}_n = \frac{1}{nh^d} \displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}K \left(\frac{x - X_i}{h}\right)
  \label{eq:kde}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  K(x) = \frac{exp(-\abs{\abs{x}}^2/2)}{v_{1,2}}, \quad v_{1,2} = \displaystyle\int exp(-\abs{\abs{x}}^2/2)dx.
  \label{eq:gaussiankernel}
\end{equation}

The center, which represents the mean, of the 0 Hz distribution lies almost exactly at 0 rad/s, while the 5 Hz distribution is skewed to the left, indicating a high probability of a positive net rotation and backing up the results of Figure~\ref{fig:velocityvstime}.

Even though angular velocity gives us a big picture of how the ratchet will change over time, it is important to see the actual rotation the ratchet had in the total of 500 s.

Figure~\ref{fig:particleangulardisplacement} shows the angular displacement of a single ratchet particle over the entire simulation. At 0 Hz, the particle shows an initial displacement but remains largely constant over time, experiencing only thermal fluctuations. This initial displacement can be due the initial interaction of the closer colloids, which move close to the walls of the ratchet and probably moving or rotating the ratchet a certain, but negligible amount, however, the remarking section is the tendency of not moving for a long period of time. In contrast, at 5 Hz, the particle exhibits a net displacement that resembles a diagonal line. 

To give meaning to the plot, we can obtain the arc length of a circle, this is assuming this as an ideal trajectory for the ratchet, therefore we use the following equation:

\begin{equation}
  s = r\theta,
  \label{eq:arclength}
\end{equation}

where $s$ is the arc length, r is the radius of our ratchet and $\theta$ is the angle formed from the particle to the initial position.
In this case we can see that its final angular position is $\theta \approx 2 rad$, and to tranlate it into a more digestable information we use Eq. (\ref{eq:arclength}) obtaining that the particle total distance traveled was $s \approx 16 \mu m$.

In the total simulation, the ratchet experienced a little less than half rotation but more than a quarter, but according to Purcell~\cite{purcell2014life}, at those regimes movement not necessarily has to be much. Nevertheless, this provides clear evidence of the frequency's dramatic effect on ratchet rotation. This aligns with the theoretical principle that work cannot be extracted from thermal fluctuations alone. However, we have identified a range of frequencies where colloidal interactions are sufficient to drive ratchet rotation.
